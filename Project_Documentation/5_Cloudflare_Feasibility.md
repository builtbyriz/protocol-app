# Feasibility Report: Cloudflare Video Analysis
**Subject:** Deploying Video Analysis on Cloudflare for White-Label App
**Date:** November 23, 2025

## 1. Can it be deployed on Cloudflare?
**Yes.** Cloudflare is an excellent choice for this architecture.

### Recommended Stack
*   **Storage**: **Cloudflare R2**. Users upload videos here. It has zero egress fees, making it much cheaper than AWS S3 for video bandwidth.
*   **Compute**: **Cloudflare Workers**. Serverless functions to handle the upload logic and trigger analysis.
*   **AI Inference**: **Cloudflare Workers AI**.
    *   *Current Status*: Cloudflare supports running AI models at the edge. You can use models like **Llama 3.2 Vision** (if available on Workers AI) or proxy the request to OpenAI GPT-4o from the Worker.
    *   *Stability*: **High**. Cloudflare's edge network is one of the most stable in the world.

## 2. Will it be stable?
**Yes, extremely stable.**
*   **No Server Management**: Cloudflare Workers are serverless. You don't need to manage EC2 instances or worry about scaling. It handles 1 user or 1 million users automatically.
*   **Global Low Latency**: The code runs in data centers close to the user (e.g., Singapore/KL nodes for your MY/SG users), ensuring fast upload speeds.

## 3. Is it good for White-Labeling?
**Yes, it is the best option.**
*   **Custom Domains**: Cloudflare makes it trivial to map `api.gym-a.com` and `api.gym-b.com` to the same Worker.
*   **Security**: You get Cloudflare's DDoS protection and WAF (Web Application Firewall) out of the box, protecting your white-label clients from attacks.

## 4. Implementation Strategy
1.  **Upload**: User uploads 10s form check video to R2 via a signed URL (generated by Worker).
2.  **Trigger**: R2 event triggers a Worker.
3.  **Analyze**: Worker sends video frames to AI (Workers AI or OpenAI).
4.  **Feedback**: AI generates feedback ("Keep back straight").
5.  **Notify**: Worker updates the database/app with the result.

## 5. Verdict
Deploying Video Analysis on Cloudflare is **Technically Sound**, **Cost-Effective** (no egress fees), and **Highly Stable** for a white-label SaaS product.
